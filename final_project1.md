# Happy Gut Happy Mind: Associations Between Gut Microbes and Positive Emotion 

## Background

Research indicates that human gut microbes impact both physiological and psychological processes, specifically, psychological well-being (Delgadillo et.al, 2022; Hantsoo & Zemel , 2021) . Indeed, numerous preclinical studies reveal that higher levels of symbiotic bacteria (beneficial to health) increase prosocial behaviors and mitigate stress responses (Cryan & Dinan, 2012), however, little is known as to whether positive emotion is linked to microbial composition in humans. To date, work assessing mind-microbiome relations has primarily focused on disease and dysfunction with scant attention given to links to positive psychosocial constructs. The current work will explore whether various types of dispositional (how they usually feel) positive affect (PA) are linked to microbial composition. This research will use an existing dataset that I collected containing all of the microbiome data and metadata needed to explore my research inquiries as described in detail below.

## Methods

The sample consisted of 75 females with a mean age of 41.6 years; 55.6% White, 23.6% Asian, 11.1% chose more than one race, 7% other, and 2.8% Native Hawaiian. This sample size was based on a power analysis with power set at 0.9 and effect size set at 0.16. The current study recruited mothers of children ages 8 to 12 years old in the Orange and Los Angeles County areas. Qualified participants completed psychological assessments on-line and received a fecal collection kit in sterile packaging, each containing a collection tube, spatula/ swab utensil, and detailed written instructions. Participants also received pre-paid shipping materials to send their samples back, were instructed not to make any major dietary changes prior to sample collection, and to collect their samples and mail them to UC Irvine within 3-14 days of participation in the study. Participants self-reported levels of dispositional Serenity, Joviality, and Emotional Well-Being on a 5-point likert scale with ‘1’ indicating very little or no experience of the emotion to ‘5’ indicating intense or extreme experience of that emotion. Participants include 75 healthy women ages 25-55 years old. Additionally, participants were asked to report on diet, age, weight, and height which will be used as covariates in statistical analyses. Next-generation pyrosequencing of the V1-V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene was used to classify microbial composition from fecal samples and determine relative and absolute abundances of bacterial genera. This data is contained in an OTU table available in a BIOM file and text document. 

## Results

We hypothesized that the endogenous microbiome, both globally and when examining specific taxa, would be linked to previously specified types of positive affect. Permutational analysis of variance analyses (PERMANOVA) of Bray-Curtis dissimilarities (used to quantify variation in genus between groups) revealed that there were no significant differences in community structure between high and low emotional wellbeing groups (R2 = 0.006, p = .96),  overall PA groups (R2 = 0.008, p = .84), Joviality groups (R2 = 0.0107, p = .67), or Serenity groups (R2 = 0.008, p = .88) on the genus level. For reference, global composition for overall PA was visualized in R using a nonparametric multidimensional scaling ordination plot using Bray-Curtis dissimilarity to calculate distances between samples on the genus level.

After controlling for the false discovery rate using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure, Spearman correlations revealed significant associations between relative abundances of *Streptococcus*, Serenity (rs = .24 , p = .045), Joviality (rs = .27, p = .024), and Emotional Well-Being (rs = .26, p = .032). *Dialister* was negatively associated with Emotional Well-Being (rs = -.25, p = .043). Since the microbiome data were zero-inflated (see figures 2 and 3) I conducted negative binomial regressions which required count data such as absolute abundances. Negative binomial regressions revealed no significant associations between *Streptococcus* and emotional wellbeing B = -.021, SEB = .019, p = .265, overall PA B = .284, SEB = .406, p = .48, Joviality B = -.124, SEB = ..354, p = .725, p = .082, or Serenity B = -.053, SEB = .317. Further, negative binomial regressions revealed no significant associations between *Dialister* and emotional wellbeing B = -.050, SEB = .032, p = .118, overall PA B = .601, SEB = .699, p = .389, Joviality B = -.149, SEB = .611, p = .052, p = .807, or Serenity B = -.763, SEB = .543, p = .16. Since there were no significant associations, calculations including covariates were not reported, however, I created two examples in which covariates were included in the negative binomial regressions to demonstrate that I can perform these analyses while accounting for diet, age, and BMI. This code can be observed in lines 56 and 75 of the .sh file.

## Discussion

Spearman correlations revealed significant positive associations between *Streptococcus* and Serenity, emotional wellbeing, and Joviality. These results complement preliminary analyses from my dissertation revealing negative association between psychological stress and relative abundances of *Streptococcus*. Further, these findings also complement literature connecting higher levels of certain strains of *Streptococcus* to adaptive psychological constructs such as reduced anxiety-like behavior (Xie et al, 2022).  Additionally, *Dialister* was negatively linked to emotional wellbeing. Research has positively linked *Dialister* to prosocial behaviors (Delgadillo et al., 2022) and is often found in lower relative abundances in those with autism (Lui et. al, 2019), thus, the negative link to emotional wellbeing in the current work is somewhat surprising. Further, while Spearman correlations of relative abundances of *Streptococcus*, *Dialister*, and PA measures were significant, they were not replicated in the assessment of absolute abundances. One possible explanation for this may be that *Streptococcus* and *Dialister* are interdependently connected to other microbes in a ratio specific manner. That is, absolute abundances are missing this ratio specific interdependence and may be a less sensitive measure when attempting to capture the signal between happiness and microbial composition. These results suggest that certain microbes are linked to specific types of positive affect in this sample of healthy females. Future researchers should test whether these results replicate in larger samples that include males as well as to what extent these microbial differences are responsible for known associations between positive affect and an array of physical health outcomes.
